<h3>Introduction</h3>
The Can Do Colorado e-Bike Program aims to show participants and those they interact with the transformative power of an e-Bike as a transportation solution. It is our hope that program participants will use their new e-Bike as a regular part of their transportation routine.

First and foremost participants are expected to use their e-Bike as their primary tool for getting to and from their places of employment or school. We also hope that the e-Bikes will be used for errands and other everyday trips, including:
<ul>
<li> ðŸš² grocery shopping
<li> ðŸš² trips to other stores
<li> ðŸš² visiting friends and family
<li> ðŸš² recreation
</ul>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
The data collected during the program will be used to determine the programâ€™s impact and effectiveness. This data will also be used to inform the design of future programs.

<h3>What we collect</h3>
If you agree to participate in this evaluation, we will automatically track your
location, accelerometer, device-generated activity recognition, app usage time
and battery usage. We will also allow you to optionally enter your experiences
and feedback during weekly surveys. Furthermore, there will be an initial
survey upon first launch of the application to collect information about your
age, socioeconomic status, and health status. This information will never be
made public or sold, and is collected directly by the Colorado Energy Office
without commercial third party involvement.  We use an open source platform,
e-mission, for the data collection. You can inspect the data that e-mission
collects in the background

<h3>How we associate your data with you</h3>
Each participant will be given a token key for registering with the program. Only Colorado Energy Office and e-Bike Program support staff will have access to the relationship between the token key and the participant. The identity of participants will not be shared with anyone or any organization outside the Colorado Energy Office and e-Bike Program support staff.

<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
Only limited Colorado Energy Office and e-Bike Program support staff will have access to the raw data. Data may be provided to approved outside organizations, however, any outside requests for data will be further anonymized through data aggregation.

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If the results
of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally
identifiable information will not be used. To minimize risks to
confidentiality, we will store study data on a secure, encrypted E-Mission
platform server. The server can only be accessed by analysts associated with
the pilot.

    <h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
    Transportation is the largest contributor to US Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions.
    As the nation's premier facility for energy-efficient transportation R&amp;D
    solutions, NREL’s sustainable transportation and mobility research takes a
    whole-system, human-centric approach to solve complex energy challenges and
    slash greenhouse gas emissions. As part of this approach we would like to
    collect long-term travel behavior data that tells us how, where and why people
    travel.
    
    This data is being collected through OpenPATH, an NREL open-sourced platform.
    The smart phone application, NREL OpenPATH (“App”), combines data from
    smartphone sensors, semantic user labels and a short demographic survey.
    
    NREL is a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of
    Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, operated by Alliance for Sustainable
    Energy, LLC under Prime Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308. This Privacy Policy
    applies to the App provided by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC. This App
    is provided solely for the purposes of collecting travel behavior data for the
    Study and for research to inform public policy. None of the data collected by
    the App will never be sold or used for any commercial purposes, including
    advertising.
    
    IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DELETE THE APP
    
    <h3>Why we collect this information</h3>
    NREL can use this information to understand how travel patterns change in
    response to federal, state and local interventions. The interventions can
    include programs, incentives and infrastructure changes. Since this data will
    be collected for a long time, changes can be directly observed instead of
    inferred from other data sources. This data can also serve as a control of
    unmodified behavior for programs that target a small sample of the population.
    
    <h3>What information we collect</h3>
    The App will never ask for any Personally Identifying Information (PII) such as
    name, email address or phone number.  
    
    It collects phone sensor data pertaining to your location (including background
    location), accelerometer, device-generated activity and mode recognition, App
    usage time, and battery usage. The App will create a “travel diary” based on
    your background location data to determine your travel patterns and location
    history.
    
    It will also ask you to periodically annotate these sensed trips with semantic
    labels, such as the trip mode, purpose, and replaced mode.
    
    It will also request sociodemographic information such as your approximate age,
    gender and household type. The sociodemographic factors can be used to
    understand the influence of lifestyle on travel behavior, as well as generalize
    the results to a broader population.
    
    For the greatest transparency, the App is based on an open source platform,
    NREL’s OpenPATH. you can inspect the data that OpenPATH collects in the background at
    <a
    href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>,
    the analysis pipeline at <a
    href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server.git</a>
    and the dashboard metrics at <a
    href="https://github.com/e-mission/em-public-dashboard.git">https://github.com/e-mission/em-public-dashboard.git</a>
    
    <h3>How we associate information with you</h3>
    A randomly generated token will be generated by the App during onboarding and
    used for all further communication with the server. Only you know the token
    that is associated with you. There is no “Forgot password” option, and NREL
    staff cannot retrieve your token, even if you provide your name or email
    address. This means that, unless you store your token in a safe place, you will
    not have access to your prior data if you switch phones or uninstall and
    reinstall the App.
    
    <h3>Who gets to see the information</h3>
    Aggregate metrics derived from the travel patterns will be made available on a public dashboard to provide transparency into the impact of the program. These metrics will focus on information summaries such as counts, distances and durations, and will not display individual travel locations or times.
    
    Real-time detailed travel patterns will only be made available to:
    <ul>
        <li> Program administrators from NREL Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences (CIMS) to monitor the Study, send personalized surveys or provide recommendations to participants, and
        <li>OpenPATH developers for debugging
    </ul>
    
    The data will also be periodically archived in NREL’s Transportation Secure
    Data Center (TSDC) after a delay of 3 to 6 months. It will then be made
    available for legitimate research through existing, privacy-preserving TSDC
    operating procedures. Further information on the procedures is available <a href="https://nrel.gov/tsdc">on the
    website</a> and in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146515002999">this publication</a> and <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70723.pdf">fact sheet</a>.
    
    <h3>Your rights</h3>
    Participation in the Study is completely voluntary. You have the right to
    decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in the Study without
    providing notice to NREL or the point of contact. If you do not wish to
    participate in the Study or to discontinue your participation in the Study,
    please delete the App.
    
    If you would like to have your data destroyed, please contact K. Shankari
    (<a href="mailto:k.shankari@nrel.gov">k.shankari@nrel.gov</a>) requesting deletion.
    You must include your token in the request for deletion. Because we do not
    connect your identity with your token, we cannot delete your information
    without obtaining the token as part of the deletion request. We will then
    destroy all data associated with that deletion request, both in the online and
    archived datasets.
    
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    If you have any questions about the data collection goals and results, please
    contact the primary point of contact for the study, K. Shankari
    (k.shankari@nrel.gov). If you have any technical questions about app operation,
    please contact NREL’s K. Shankari (k.shankari@nrel.gov).
